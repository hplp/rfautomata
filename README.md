Random Forest Automata

This is an open-source implementation of Random Forests as automata on Micron's Automata Processor. In short, this code trains a Random Forest with Scikit Learn, and transforms the resulting model into ANML, an XML-like representation for the Automata Processor.

If you use this code for research purposes, please cite the below paper which introduces the contained algorithms.
